## JavaScript Comment

Create a comment component to match the provided mock.  All data in the comment should be pulled from JavaScript. You may replace the user image with an image of your choice.

# Requirements:

- It should visually match the mock
- Include a readme
- Include tests
- All data should be separated from the template
- The “reply”, “{n} replies”, and up/down arrow counts are each interactive elements (they do not need to function, but should be coded as interactive elements)
- When the entire comment is hovered, the light-grey items (“reply”, “{n} replies”, and up/down arrows with counts) should become visibly darker
